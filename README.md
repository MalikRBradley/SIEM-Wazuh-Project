# üîç Windows Security Detection Lab with Wazuh + Sysmon (Azure SOC Simulation)

This hands-on project demonstrates how to detect suspicious activity on a Windows 11 VM using **Wazuh** (deployed on Azure) and **Sysmon** for detailed endpoint telemetry. The simulation involves creating a fake admin account and launching a brute-force attack to trigger alerts and visualize real-time detection.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Environment

- **Wazuh SIEM** (v4.11.2, deployed on Ubuntu VM via Azure)
- **Sysmon** for Windows Event ID telemetry
- **Windows 11 VM** for adversary simulation
- **Kali Linux** (Hydra brute-force testing)
- **Microsoft Azure** (NSG configuration, VM management)
- **VMware** on Mac M3 ARM64

---

## üö® What Was Simulated

- Created a fake admin account on Windows using PowerShell
- Installed and configured Sysmon agent
- Captured Windows Event ID changes in Wazuh
- Launched a brute-force RDP attack using Hydra from Kali
- Validated alerts in Wazuh's Threat Hunting and Event dashboards
